# My First Game
 Snake game made in Godot

1Ô∏è‚É£ Grab the source
```
git clone https://github.com/Prarambha369/Snakey.git
cd Snakey
```

You should now see a typical Godot folder layout:
```
project.godot        ‚Üê main project file
assets/              ‚Üê sprites, sounds, etc.
scenes/              ‚Üê *.tscn scene files
scripts/             ‚Üê *.gd scripts
export_presets.cfg   ‚Üê export settings (may be empty)
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Godot
PlatformQuick install
WindowsDownload the official portable ZIP from https://godotengine.org/download/windows (choose the stable 4.x build) and unzip it somewhere, e.g. `C:\Godot\`.
macOSGrab the .dmg from the same page, drag the app to `/Applications`.
LinuxEither use your distro's package manager (sudo apt install godot3 for older 3.x, or grab the official binary from the website) or download the `Linux x86_64 ZIP` and extract it.

Make sure you have Godot 4.x (the current stable series) because the project was created with that version.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Open the project in Godot

    Launch the Godot editor (Godot_v4.x.exe or godot from the terminal).
    Click Import ‚Üí Browse, navigate to the folder you just cloned, select project.godot, and click Import & Edit.
    The editor will load the project and you should see the main scene (likely something like scenes/Main.tscn) in the Scene panel.

Press Play (F5) to test it instantly. If everything loads correctly you'll see the Snake game window pop up.
