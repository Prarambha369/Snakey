# My First Game
 Snake game made in Godot

1️⃣ Grab the source
```
git clone https://github.com/Prarambha369/Snakey.git
cd Snakey
```

You should now see a typical Godot folder layout:
```
project.godot        ← main project file
assets/              ← sprites, sounds, etc.
scenes/              ← *.tscn scene files
scripts/             ← *.gd scripts
export_presets.cfg   ← export settings (may be empty)
```

2️⃣ Install Godot
Platform	Quick install
Windows	Download the official portable ZIP from https://godotengine.org/download/windows (choose the stable 4.x build) and unzip it somewhere, e.g. `C:\Godot\`.
macOS	Grab the .dmg from the same page, drag the app to `/Applications`.
Linux	Either use your distro’s package manager (sudo apt install godot3 for older 3.x, or grab the official binary from the website) or download the `Linux x86_64 ZIP` and extract it.

Make sure you have Godot 4.x (the current stable series) because the project was created with that version.
3️⃣ Open the project in Godot

    Launch the Godot editor (Godot_v4.x.exe or godot from the terminal).
    Click Import → Browse, navigate to the folder you just cloned, select project.godot, and click Import & Edit.
    The editor will load the project and you should see the main scene (likely something like scenes/Main.tscn) in the Scene panel.

Press Play (F5) to test it instantly. If everything loads correctly you’ll see the Snake game window pop up.
